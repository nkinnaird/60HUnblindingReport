\chapter{Analysis Procedures}
\label{Ch:Procedures}


\section{Key parameters in reconstruction method}

	Default parameters used in the Recon West production of the 60H dataset, with SAM dataset name ``gm2pro\_daq\_full\_run1\_60h\_5036A\_goldList''.

\section{Analysis Data Preparation Procedure}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item{git branch: gm2analyses branch feature/KinnairdAnalyses}
		\item{Majority of code located under gm2analyses/macros/RatioMacro}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Submit jobs to OSG to run the rootTreesAndLostMuons.fcl file which produces \texttt{ROOT} trees of positron hits using the ClusterTree analyzer module and coincident MIP hits using the TestCoincidenceFinder analyzer module.}
		\item{Submit jobs to Fermigrid to produce histograms from \texttt{ROOT} trees using the ClusterTreeToHistsPileup.C macro in RatioMacro/HistMaking, 1 job per \texttt{ROOT} tree. Beyond standard $e^{+}$ arrival time histograms this macro produces pileup and lost muon histograms all within the same \texttt{ROOT} file.}
		\item{ClusterTreeToHistsPileup.C uses a single random seed for all randomization during histogram making. The default for the random seed is the hash of the input \texttt{ROOT} file name so that results can be reproduced on the grid, and so that each individual grid job uses a unique random seed.}
	\end{enumerate}


\section{Histogramming Procedure}

	Method: Ratio (\DB{13080}, \cite{DenverRatioTalk}) \\
	\noindent Systematics Sections \ref{SubSec:gm2Guess} and \ref{SubSec:LifetimeWeighting}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Loop through all clusters and apply an artificial deadtime (ADT) to combine hits within 6 ns into a single pulse using the same procedure and code that the pileup method uses (see below). Drop clusters with time $< \SI{25}{\mu s}$ or time $> \SI{660}{\mu s}$.}
		\item{Histograms are constructed with \texttt{ROOT}'s \texttt{TH1F} class with 149.2 ns bins from $0 - \SI{699.8972}{\mu s}$ corresponding to 4691 bins, of which 4256 are filled with data, and 4154 are fit with a fit range of $\SI{30.2}{\mu s} - \SI{650}{\mu s}$.}
		\item{Randomize cluster times by $\pm 149.2/2$ ns and fill histograms for energies $> 1.7$ GeV. Randomization uses \texttt{ROOT}'s default \texttt{TRandom3} class.}
		\item{Divide the data into four datasets by filling one of the four histograms \{$u_{+}(t), u_{-}(t), v_{1}(t), v_{2}(t)$\} per cluster. The associated histogram is determined by generating a random number between 0 and 1, and comparing that number to the relative probabilities of the different weights:
			\begin{align}
				u_{+}(t) : u_{-}(t) : v_{1}(t) : v_{2}(t) = e^{T/2\tau} : e^{-T/2\tau} : 1 : 1
			\end{align}
		$\tau$ is the lifetime of the muon, taken at $\SI{64.4}{\mu s}$. See the appendix for more details on what this weighting scheme does.}
		\item{Clusters filled into the $u_{+}(t)$ histogram have their times shifted by $t \rightarrow t - T_{a}/2$ and clusters filled into the $u_{-}(t)$ histogram have their times shifted by $t \rightarrow t + T_{a}/2$.}
		\item{$T_{a}$ is known a priori to high precision from the previous experiment, and its value is taken as $1/f_{a}$, where $f_{a}$ is \SI{0.2290735}{MHz}:
			\begin{align}
				T_{a} \approx \SI{4.365411}{\mu s}
			\label{eq:Ta}
			\end{align}
		This value for $f_{a}$ was determined by averaging column 2 of Table XV of the E821 Final Report \cite{E821FinalReport}, which consits of the $f_{a}$ results for the different run periods in that experiment. A systematic error on the choice of this parameter is calculated in Section \ref{SubSec:gm2Guess}.}
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Gain Correction Procedure}

	Gain correction method: Default by the Italian Calibration Team (\DB{16003}, \cite{60HGain}) \\
	\noindent Systematics Section \ref{Sec:SystematicGain}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Long term gain is corrected using out-of-fill laser shots including normalization from the Source Monitor.}
		\item{In-fill gain is corrected using in-fill laser shots including normalization from the Source Monitor.}
		\item{Short-term double pulse (SDTP) effect is not yet included, but will be for the final report.}
	\end{enumerate}


\section{Pileup Correction Procedure}
\label{Sec:PileupCorrection}

	Pileup correction method: Asymmetric shadow window (\DB{14394}, \cite{Pileup1} and \DB{14830}, \cite{Pileup2}, \cite{Pileup3}) \\
	\noindent Systematics Section \ref{Sec:SystematicPileup}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Create a vector of clusters per calorimeter per fill. For each cluster look for a second cluster in a window from 12-18 ns after the time of the first cluster. This corresponds to a shadow dead time (SDT) of 6 ns and a shadow gap time (SGT) of 12 ns, equal to 1 and 2 times the applied ADT respectively.}
		\item{Create shadow doublets with energies and times as:
			\begin{gather}
				E_{doublet} = C \cdot (E_{1} + E_{2}), \\
				t_{doublet} = \frac{t_{1} \cdot E_{1} + (t_{2}-SGT) \cdot E_{2}}{E_{1} + E_{2}},
			\end{gather}
		where the latter equation is the energy-weighted average of the times of the two singlets. In the former equation, the calculation of the doublet energy is the sum of the singlets times some calibration factor. That factor is set equal to 1, which is a reasonable approximation since the spatial separation in the reconstruction is turned off. The systematic effects of a factor not equal to 1 are studied in Section \ref{SubSec:PileupPhase}.}
		\item{Randomize $t_{doublet}$ times by $\pm 149.2/2$ ns as in the histogramming procedure described above.}
		\item{For each calorimeter construct a pileup spectrum P = doublets - singlets = D - S, where the singlets are subtracted at time $t_{doublet}$ as opposed to their individual times, and pulses are only added or subtracted if they are above 1.7 GeV. Subtract P off energy and threshold histograms.}
		\item{For pileup subraction in the ratio method, randomly split doublets and singlets into 4 separate histograms as is done in the histogramming procedure described above, with times shifted accordingly. Doublets and their associated singlets are put in the same histogram. Subtract 4 pileup histograms from corresponding \{$u_{+}(t), u_{-}(t), v_{1}(t), v_{2}(t)$\} histograms before forming the ratio.}
		\item{The errors of the pileup corrected histogram were determined to be: 
			\begin{gather}
				\sigma(N_{corrected}) = \sqrt{N_{corrected} + 2 N_{1} + 6 N_{4}},
			\end{gather}
		where $N_{1}$ is the number of doublets where both singlets were below threshold, and $N_{4}$ is the number of doublets where both singlets were above threshold, and this is a quantity evaluated at each time bin (\DB{14830}, \cite{Pileup2}). A histogram of error multipliers was created by factoring out the $N_{corrected}$ term, which is then applied to the bin errors before fitting. This is true even for the ratio errors to good approximation (Appendix B.4 \cite{JPThesis}). Note that I did not time randomize the $N_{1}$ and $N_{4}$ entries when constructing the correct errors, which is a negligble effect. This is justified in \DB{14394}, \cite{Pileup1} slide 11, which shows that this is about a 2 ppb effect. (The pileup is about a 1\% effect, including the pileup errors is about 1\% effect on that, and then time randomizing the errors is less than that.)}
		\item{The pileup correction at the triplet/contamination level is not included. It has been determined not be necessary for the 60H and Run 1 data.}
	\end{enumerate}


\section{Lost muon spectrum extraction procedure}
\label{Sec:LM}

	Method: Triple coincidence of clusters (\DB{12912}, \cite{MuonLosses}) \\
	\noindent Systematics Section \ref{Sec:SystematicLM} \\

	Note that the lost muons are not included in the ratio fit because the ratio method divides out such slow effects. This is reflected by the lack of a low frequency peak in the FFT of the fit residuals for the ratio fit, whereas such a peak exists for T method fits. I include here however my method for extracting the lost muon function for systematic studies.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Triple coincidence of clusters in 3 consecutive calorimeters are made with an energy cut of 100 MeV $<$ E $<$ 250 MeV and 5 ns $<$ dt $<$ 8.5 ns.}
		\item{A time histogram is made with the muon cluster in the first calorimeter.}
		\item{The function that would be used in the final fit is:
			\begin{gather}
				\Lambda(t) = 1 - \kappa_{loss} \int_{0}^{t} L(t')e^{(t'/\gamma\tau_{\mu})} dt'
			\end{gather}
		where $L(t)$ is the histogram of triple concidences, and an arbitrary $10^{-6}$ factor has been absorbed into $\kappa_{loss}$ in order to bring it to a more reasonable value (from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$).}
	\end{enumerate}


\section{Beam Dynamics: CBO Model}
\label{Sec:CBO}

	\noindent Systematics Section \ref{Sec:SystematicCBO}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{The CBO frequency as a function of time is taken from the tracking analysis, \DB{14208}, \cite{TrackerFreq}, and shown in Figure \ref{fig:TrackerCBOModel}. The CBO frequency is not constant during the measurement time because the quad voltage was not constant as a function of time. As described in that document, the source of this is almost certainly the fact that some of the quad resistors were damaged, leading to longer RC time constants. The form used is:
			\begin{gather}
				\omega_{cbo}(t) = \omega_{cbo} \cdot (1 + \Delta\omega t + A e^{-t/\tau_{A}} + B e^{-t/\tau_{B}}),
			\label{Eqn:CBOFreq}
			\end{gather}
		with parameters determined from station 12 in the 60H dataset and fixed in the fit as:
			\begin{equation*}	
			\begin{aligned}
			 	\Delta\omega &= \SI{1.86e-5}{\mu s^{-1}}, \\
			 	A &= -0.0504, \\
			 	\tau_{A} &= \SI{73.3}{\mu s}, \\
			 	B &= -0.131, \\
			 	\tau_{B} &= \SI{16.6}{\mu s}. \\
			\end{aligned}
			\end{equation*}
		The parameter $\omega_{cbo}$ is allowed to float in the fit and starts with a value of $\SI{2.3051}{rad.\mu s^{-1}}$. Because the ratio method divides out the CBO partially (reduction by a factor of $\sim5$ in the FFT CBO peak amplitude), the ratio method has trouble with letting the other frequency parameters float, and fixing them to slightly different values does not change the fit results significantly. Parameter values determined from station 18 are similar to those from station 12 and were also tested with no significant change in the fit results. See Section \ref{Sec:CBOFreq}.}
		\item{Because the ratio method divides out the CBO partially, the ratio fit can have a hard time fitting the CBO lifetime. The ratio fit converges to a $\tau_{cbo}$ value with a relatively large error. This is acceptable for a single fit to the calorimeter sum as well as the individual calorimeter fits, but less sucessful for fit start time scans where less and less data is fit. In the latter $\tau_{cbo}$ is fixed to the value from the single calorimeter sum fit.}
		\item{An exponential function is assumed for the CBO decoherence. Other models are tested in Section \ref{SubSec:CBOShape}.}
		% \item{In the calorimeter sum fit, the $N_{cbo}$, $N_{2cbo}$, and $A_{cbo}$ terms are included in the fit, while the $\phi_{cbo}$ term is excluded. The $N_{2cbo}$ and $A_{cbo}$ amplitudes have errors of order half the amplitude, but converge acceptably, while the error on the $\phi_{cbo}$ amplitude is of the same order as the amplitude, and thus excluded. For fit start scans, the phases of the $N_{2cbo}$ and $A_{cbo}$ terms are fixed to the values determined from a single fit to the calorimeter sum. For the individual calorimeter fits, the $\phi_{cbo}$ term is included, and all CBO amplitude and phase parameters converge nicely.}
		\item{In the calorimeter sum fit the $N_{cbo}$ term is included, while the $N_{2cbo}$, $A_{cbo}$, and $\phi_{cbo}$ terms are excluded. The latter terms all have errors the same order as the amplitude or greater, and are thus excluded. For the individual calorimeter fits, the listed terms are included, and all CBO amplitude and phase parameters converge nicely. The effects of including the omitted terms are examined in Section \ref{SubSec:CBOFitTerms}.}
		\item{The CBO function pieces are:
			\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
					N_{cbo}(t) &= 1 + A_{cbo-N} \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{cbo}} \cdot \cos(\omega_{cbo}(t) \cdot t + \phi_{cbo-N}), \\
					N_{2cbo}(t) &= 1 + A_{2cbo-N} \cdot e^{-t/(\tau_{cbo}/2)} \cdot \cos(2 \cdot \omega_{cbo}(t) \cdot t + \phi_{2cbo-N}), \\
					A_{cbo}(t) &= 1 + A_{cbo-A} \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{cbo}} \cdot \cos(\omega_{cbo}(t) \cdot t + \phi_{cbo-A}), \\
					\phi_{cbo}(t) &= 1 + A_{cbo-\phi} \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{cbo}} \cdot \cos(\omega_{cbo}(t) \cdot t + \phi_{cbo-\phi}).
			\label{eqn:CBO}
			\end{aligned}
			\end{equation}
		Note the factor of $1/2$ in the lifetime of the $N_{2cbo}$ term. From Aaron - The damping comes from the decoherence which comes from a spread in frequencies. The spread in frequencies is tied to the momentum distribution, so if the frequency is twice for the same momentum, the decoherence time should be half.

\section{Beam Dynamics: Vertical Waist Model}
\label{Sec:VW}

	\noindent Systematics Section \ref{Sec:SystematicVW} \\

	\wa is senstive to the vertical width of the beam, which is characterized by the frequency 
		\begin{gather}
			f_{VW} = f_{cyc} - 2f_{y}, \\
			f_{y} = f_{cbo} \sqrt{\frac{2f_{cyc}}{f_{cbo}} - 1},
		\end{gather}
	where $f_{cyc}$ is the cyclotron frequency and $f_{cbo}$ is the radial CBO frequency of the beam. In the 60H dataset $f_{VW} \approx \SI{2.3}{MHz} \approx 10 \cdot \omega_{a}$, which is an even multiple of the \gmtwo frequency. Any frequencies which are even multiples of the \gmtwo frequency largely cancel in the ratio. This is shown for the vertical waist in Figure \ref{fig:VWPlot}. This combined with the time randomization to remove the fast rotation ($f_{cyc}$) means the vertical waist does not need to be included in the ratio fit. For systematic studies including the VW the follow are taken:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{An exponential function is assumed for the VW decoherence as in the CBO, and so the VW term is defined as
				\begin{gather}
						V(t) = 1 + A_{VW} e^{-t/\tau_{VW}} \cos(\omega_{VW}t + \phi_{VW})
				\end{gather}
			}
			\item{$\omega_{VW}$ is assumed to be a constant value even though the CBO frequency changes vs time.}
		\end{enumerate}

	\begin{figure}[]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{VWPlot}
	    \caption[VWPlot]{Plotted is the difference in the maximum value of the ratio with and without a vertical waist function included, as a function of both the amplitude of the vertical waist effect and the vertical waist frequency in units of the \gmtwo frequency. (Note that this is not R the frequency fit parameter, but the actual value of the ratio fit function.) This plot was created using a \texttt{TF1} in \texttt{ROOT}. As is shown the difference reaches a minimum for even multiples of the \gmtwo frequency. The 60H dataset lives at the bottom center of this plot, marked by a red circle, where the difference in the ratio is approximately \SI{5e-6}{} at 30 $\mu s$.}

\section{Final Fit Function}
\label{Sec:FinalFitFunction}

	The following function is used for the final fit for the calorimeter sum:
	\begin{gather}
		R(t) = \frac{2f(t) - f_{+}(t) - f_{-}(t)}{2f(t) + f_{+}(t) + f_{-}(t)} \\[6pt]
		f_{\pm}(t) = f(t \pm T_{a}/2) \\[6pt]
		f(t) = N_{cbo}(t) \cdot (1 + A \cdot \cos(\omega_{a}t + \phi)) \\[6pt]
		N_{cbo}(t) = 1 + A_{cbo-N} \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{cbo}} \cdot \cos(\omega_{cbo}(t) \cdot t + \phi_{cbo-N}) \\[6pt]
		\omega_{cbo}(t) = \omega_{cbo} \cdot (1 + \delta_{cbo}(t)) \text{, $\delta_{cbo}(t)$ fixed} \\[6pt]
		\omega_{a} = 2 \pi \cdot \SI{0.2291}{MHz} \cdot (1 + R \times 10^{-6})
	\end{gather}
	All parameters are floating except for the terms in $\delta_{cbo}(t)$ as described in Section \ref{Sec:CBO}. The individual calorimeters use the same fit function, except with the other CBO terms included:
	\begin{gather}
			f(t) = N_{cbo}(t) \cdot N_{2cbo}(t) \cdot (1 + A \cdot A_{cbo}(t) \cdot \cos(\omega_{a}t + \phi \cdot \phi_{cbo}(t)))
	\end{gather}
	In all the fits, \wa is blinded by some amount of ppm in R, as described in \DB{11232}, \cite{SoftwareBlinding}. Finally, the value of the fit function in each time bin is calculated as the integral of the function over the bin, divided by the bin width. It's important to note that fitting with the integral is necessary in order to fit the asymmetry properly, corresponding to the asymmetry value returned by a T Method likelihood fit, and such that its value does not depend on the fit start time. This improves the goodness-of-fit, helps to avoid any pulling on R and push the fit end time out to late times with less data, as well as fixes the asymmetry versus start time plot.
