\chapter{Conclusion and Final Result}
\label{Ch:Conclusion}


For the 60H dataset with the gold quality cuts, I have measured a blinded \wa (R) value of
	\begin{gather}
		R = -20.38 \pm 1.330 \text{ (stat.)} \pm 0.062 \text{ (syst.) ppm},
	\end{gather}
with a reduced $\chi^{2}/NDF$ of 4178/4148 using a 7 parameter ratio method fit as described in Section \ref{Sec:FinalFitFunction}. A summary of the estimated systematic errors is given in Table \ref{Tab:Systematics}, with more work to be done in various areas. As can be seen the systematic error is significantly smaller than the statistical error for this dataset. The R value determined here was found to be consistent with the other analyses during the relative unblinding exercise held on February 26, 2019, within expectations. Going forward, systematic uncertainty evaluations will be improved, and the other datasets including the ``9D'' and ``Endgame'' datasets will be analyzed.
