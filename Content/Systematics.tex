\section{Sensitivity of \texorpdfstring{$\omega_{a}$}{} to pileup}

The systematic error on R due to the pileup construction consists primarily of two parts, the error due to misconstruction of the amplitude and the phase of the pileup. The error due to the amplitude misconstruction was calculated by scanning over a pileup multiplier parameter, from 90\% of the calculated pileup amplitude to 110\%, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PileupMultiplier}. The sensitivity of R to the amplitude was determined to be 509.1 ppb per unit amplitude. The uncertainty of the pileup amplitude construction was determined by fitting a parabola to the \chisq as a function of the pileup amplitude, and taking the width of that parabola as the uncertainty. This width is determined as the distance in X for the \chisq to rise by 1 from the minimum, also calculated as $\sqrt{2/(\chi^{2})''}$.

This corresponds to an uncertainty of $\sqrt{1/508.4} = 0.0444$ or 4.44\%. The minimum of the \chisq plot of 1.022 lies at approximately .5$\sigma$ away from 1, which is consistent and nice to see. Then, calculating the systematic error on R due to the pileup amplitude construction as 
	\begin{align}
		\delta R_{pm} = \delta\alpha_{pm} \times \frac{dR}{d\alpha_{pm}}
	\end{align}
where $\delta\alpha_{pm}$ is the uncertainty on the pileup amplitude, the systematic error on R is calculated as 509.1 pbb $\times 0.0444 = 22.6$ ppb.
