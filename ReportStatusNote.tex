This report is unfinished and still a work in progress. Various parts of the report were written on separate datasets, 5033A and 5033D, in preparation for the final dataset. All plots and results will be reproduced once the final dataset is available. The analysis procedures section should be up to date, while the analysis results and systematics sections depict results from slightly different fitting procedures. While the final systematic uncertainty numbers should not change significantly, nor the trends of the various analysis checks, please ignore any exact final fit numbers presented, and instead focus on the methods of analysis instead. (Some charts are filled with random numbers temporarily, especially in the T method comparison section.) \\

Feel free to shoot me any questions you have at nickkinn@bu.edu. \\
